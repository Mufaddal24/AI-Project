Department of Information Technology, Government of India is providing support for these projects to the state. SWAN (State Wide Area Network) is envisaged as the converged backbone network for data, voice and video communications throughout the State/UT and is expected to cater to the information communication requirements of all the departments. Key focus of the SWAN project is on high service delivery. As per SWAN policy, all States/UTs are implementing SWAN under two Options. Under the first Option, the State is to select a suitable Public Private Partnership (PPP) model and get the SWAN commissioned and operated for 5 years by a private Network Operator. In the second Option, the SWAN for the States/UTs would be set up and operated for 5 years by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).

As per 5th Minor Irrigation Census 2013-2014, there are 5.16 lakh tanks and storages in the country as minor irrigation sources, out of which 4.62 lakh tanks are in use, and the remaining 0.53 lakh tanks are not in use. Many of these water bodies have gone into disuse because of the development of ground water irrigation systems, inadequate maintenance, encroachments, less discharge of water, storage not filled up fully, siltation of storage, salinity, drying up, getting destroyed beyond repair etc. A pilot scheme for \u201cRepair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies directly linked to Agriculture\u201d was launched in January, 2005 for implementation during the remaining period of Xth Plan with an outlay of Rs. 300 crore. The scheme was sanctioned in respect of 1,098 water bodies in 26 districts of 15 States, with a target to create 0.78 lakh hectare of additional irrigation potential.",
