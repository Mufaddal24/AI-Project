Massive and strategic investments have been made\nunder the National Health Mission (NHM) for improvement of maternal health.\nThe National Health Mission has provided support for the implementation of key\nnational policies and programs. As India strives towards achieving the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), progress in reducing maternal mortality becomes an\nimportant frontier. Continuous efforts have been taken to ensure that the pregnant\nmothersreceive special care.\nWith sustained efforts the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of India\nreduced from 167, per 100,000 live births in SRS 2011-13 to 130 in SRS 2014-16\nwhich further reduced to 122 per 100,000 live births in 2015-172\n. The pace of\ndecline in MMR since 1990 has been 78 per cent, which is higher than the global\ndecline of 45 per cent. Considering the compound annual rate of decline in the last\nten years, India is likely to achieve the SDG target of MMR by 2025 (SDG 3 Goal\nof MMR: 70/100,000 live births by 2030). As per the Sample Registration system\n(SRS) 2015-17, three States such as Kerala (42), Tamil Nadu (63) & Maharashtra\n(55) have already attained the SDG target of MMR: Eleven States, namely, Kerala,\nMaharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Gujarat,\nUttarakhand, West Bengal, Karnataka and Haryana have achieved the target set\nunder the National Health Policy 2017 (NHP target of MMR: 100/lakh Live Births\nby 2020).\nGlobally, the World\u2019s MMR fell by nearly 44 per cent over the past 25 years,\nto an estimated 216 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2015, from an MMR\nof 385 in 1990 at an average annual decline of 2.3 per cent, While India recorded a\ndecline of 77 per cent reduction in maternal deaths over 25 years.\nThe other maternal healthcare indicators have also improved significantly from\nthe NFHS4\n-3 (2005-06) to NFHS-4 (2015-16). Institutional deliveries have\nincreased from 38.7 per cent to 78.9 per cent, along with the percentage of\ndeliveries taking place in public institutions from 18 per cent to 52 per cent. Skilled\nbirth also increased from 46.6 per cent (NFHS-3) to 81.4 per cent (NFHS-4).\nThe detailed State-wise table on maternal deaths is given below:5\nSI.

Nine\nStates in the country currently have C-Section rates of over 30 per cent. Most\nof the Empowered Action Group (EAG)7\n States/UTs have C-section rates of\nless than 10 per cent which pose a challenge for providing access to emergency\nobstetric care and therefore contribute to maternal mortality in these\nStates/UTs.\n\uf0b7 Quality care around child birth relating to Intrapartum and immediate\npostpartum care: It is estimated that approximately 46 percent maternal\ndeaths, over 40 per cent stillbirths and 25 per cent of Under-5 deaths take place\non the day of the delivery. In India, as per Sample Registration System report\n(2017) of Registrar General of India, neonatal deaths account around 60per\ncent all deaths among children under age 5. Nearly, 70 percent of infant deaths\noccur in the first month of life. Among those, nearly 80 per cent die in their\nfirst week out of which (1st week newborn mortality) nearly 40per cent deaths\nhappen on the day of birth only. Half of the maternal deaths each year can be\nprevented if quality health care is provided. Quality of care is increasingly\nrecognized as a critical aspect of the maternal and newborn health agenda,\nmainly with respect to the care around labour and delivery and in the\nimmediate postnatal period.\n\uf0b7 Unsafe abortion: Unsafe abortion contributes for nearly eightper cent of all\nmaternal deaths in India which is a substantial contribution to maternal\nmortality and morbidity.\n\uf0b7 Shortage of trained Human Resources: As per the Rural Health Statistics\n(RHS) 2019, only 25 per cent (1351) obstetricians are in place against 5335 at\nCommunity Health Centres across the country. This holds a similar situation\nfor the deployment of paediatricians because of the skewed presence of\nspecialists in urban areas.\n\uf0b7 Functionality of CEmONC facilities: Efforts are on to strengthen the\nComprehensive Emergency Obstetric and New Born Care (CEmONC). The\nfacilities available at present are not adequate in infrastructure and manpower\nin many parts of the country, especially in the Empowered Action Group\n(EAG) states. Only 1588 First Referral Units (FRUs) out of 3150 fulfil the\nconditionality criteria.",
